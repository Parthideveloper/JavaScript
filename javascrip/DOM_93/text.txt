what is LocalStorage ?

In Web development, LocalStorage is part of the Web Storage API, which allows you to store Key-value pairs locally in the user's Web browser. It provides persistent Storage that remains even when the browser is closed and reopened.


The localStorage object is property of the window object in the browser's JavaScriptenvironment. It provides the following methods to interact with the stored data:


* localStorage.setItem(key, value) :--> This method sets a value in localstorage for a given key. The key and value are stored and strings


* localStorage.getItem(key) :--> This method retrieves the value associated with a given key from localstorage. If the key does not exist, it returns null.


* localstorage.removeItem(key) :--> This method removes a key-value pair from localstorage based on the provided key.

* localstorage.Clear() :--> This method removes all key-value pairs from localStorage, effectively clearing the entire storage.
